# wackpack-webring
im going to host stuff for a wackpack web ring here
##wtf is a webring
old school way of browsing the net, basically people's sites served as nodes in a circular graph and they would show it in a widget in their site. the widget would then link to adjacent nodes, and also offer a random option as well. webrings could be between friend groups, communities, or entire groups of interest like fandoms and industries. since search engines keep getting shittier, webrings are being revived as part of a greater oldnet revival movement. also it is fun. 
##license
